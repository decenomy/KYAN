# DECENOMY Improvement Proposals (DEIPs)

DECENOMY projects need a way how to document their technical decisions and features. Therefore:

DEIP stands for DECENOMY Improvement Proposal. Similar to Bitcoin's BIPs, and Dash's DIPs, a DEIP is a design document providing: information to the DECENOMY community, or a description of a new feature for the DECENOMY Standard Wallet (DSW), or a description of its processes or environment. Each DEIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

Because DSW is forked from the PIVX codebase, that is also forked from Dash codebase, that is also forked from Bitcoin codebase, many of the BIPs and DIPs can be applied to DSW as well. 

## Contributions

We use the same general guidelines for introducing a new DEIP as specified in [BIP 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki), with a few differences. Specifically:

* Instead of the BIP editor, initiate contact with the DECENOMY development team and your request should be routed to a DEIP editor(s). The DEIP workflow mimics the DIP/BIP workflow.
* Recommended licenses include the MIT license
* Markdown format is the preferred format for DEIPs
* Following a discussion, the proposal should be submitted to the DEIPs git repository as a pull request. This draft must be written in BIP/DIP/DEIP style as described in [BIP 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki), and named with an alias such as "dip-johndoe-infinitedecenomy" until the editor has assigned it a DEIP number (authors MUST NOT self-assign DEIP numbers).
* Having a DEIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.
